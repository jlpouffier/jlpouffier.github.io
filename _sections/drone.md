I like to explain how I got into the hobby of FPV Drone Freestlying as an iterative refinement process of one of my hobby.

I have always been interested by photography. The next logical step was to try cinematography. I loved the creative aspect, I liked the post-production process, especially coupling my shots with music.
In the end I was looking for something more dynamic.

So I bought a consumer drone, liked a lot of people. For a long time I was satisfied with it. I took it everywhere and did some great edits with it.
Eventually, I got bored by what my drone could produce. It was too smooth, too slow, too secure, too controled, so I looked for something more ... raw.

I ended building my own drone and discoverd the wonderful world of FVP (First Person View) : Flying with immervise goggles.
