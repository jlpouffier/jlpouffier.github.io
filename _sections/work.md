I have an engineering background. Mechanical and Industrial engineering to be exact.

I tried to enter the I.T world at the end of my studies, because it was my passion. It turned out to be the best choice I could have made !

## Amadeus
I worked at [Amadeus](https://amadeus.com/), first as a **Business Analyst**, then as a **Product Manager**. 

I worked on a platform called *RailYourWay*, used by thousands of travel agents accros Europe to book and manage train reservations. I was responsible of the integration of all the french railway inventories (including the ones crossing borders such as *Eursotar* and *Thalys*) into the platform. 

The platform is mostly used in the B2B world, but neverheless, I had the chance to participate in a few B2C projects that I can showcase here. 
*RailYourWay* has been integrated on the following website to allow internationnal, multi-provider booking accross Europe :
- [Deutsche Banh](https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml)
- [SBB](https://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html)

## Ricardo
I currently work at [ricardo.ch](https://www.ricardo.ch/fr/) as a **Product Manager**. I am responsible of all the after-sales touchpoints: Payment, Logistics.
