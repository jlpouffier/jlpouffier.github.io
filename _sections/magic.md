My grandfather was a stage illusionist, my father has always been good at handling cards and doing small magic tricks to his friends. Both of then have transmitted to me their passion for the *deceptive arts*.

I bought my first deck of cards when I was at the university, as a way to relax. It's been more than *10 years* that I handles cards as a hobby.
