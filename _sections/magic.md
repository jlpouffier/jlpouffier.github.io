My grandfather was a stage illusionist, my father has always been good at handling cards and doing small magic trics to his friends. Both of then have transmitted their passion for the deceptive arts to me.

I bought my first deck of cards when I was at the university, as a way to relax. It's been more than 10 years that I handles cards as a hobby.
