I became homeowner mid-2019, so I decided to try *home automation*.

Here is a small overview of the components that I manage to connect together:
- Almost all my light bulbs
- My window blinds
- The TV
- My vaccum cleaner
- My electrical board
- A local voice assistant (based on [snips.ai](https://snips.ai/) that is unfortunatelly not open source anymore.)
- A telegram chatbot
- Waze
- Other miscelanious integrations ...

I created a video where I explain the architecture, the automations and I do some demos, you can check it below
